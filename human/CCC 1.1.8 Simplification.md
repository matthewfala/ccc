Hi I worked with another agent to do a reference implementation to implement the 1.1.8 Feedback in the human folder and the 1.1.8 Change feedback in the human folder. The scope      
  ballooned as we did various tests. Would you please analyze all the results? We got a somewhat working implementation, however I want to simplify it. Would you please boil down the  
  specs to a single clean 1 page document outlining the core requirements that stem from the human documents, and then below discussing other added features that are more out of       
  scope?  Please put it in the simplify folder. I'll take a look, and ideally we can come up with a minimal-spec that could be passed to another instance for implememntation. So the first doc, let's use to discuss core vs  
  more fringe requirements and features (we can leave the details in the large artifacts generated). Then let's work to create a comprhensive minimal spec which contains all implementation information, so if I were to give it to another agent that DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE REFERENCE IMPLEMENATION, then it would still be able to implement it with just that spec, and the human folder along with the existing code (apart from the reference implementation)
